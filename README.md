# Busy Busy Schedular 

## Description

This project was created in order to plan someone's busy workday schedule for a typical 9 to 5 job. This scholar lets the user plan for future obligations as well as track past tasks. In this project, I learned the many different time/date formatting that day.js has to offer.

## Usage

Navigate to the live website using the link below. After that, the daily work planner should appear before you during regular business hours. By clicking on certain time slots you can add todos and reminders that can be saved for later viewing.
